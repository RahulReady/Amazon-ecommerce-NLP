    "## What is Amazon Comprehend?\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon comprehend is one of the many AI tools that AWS offers. This one is specifically designed for Natural language processing, and we can divide it's capabilities into 2 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On one side we have the **prebuilt models**, which are tools that allow you to send text over a request and directly get insights with no training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other side we have **custom classifiers**. If you aim to classify text with a certain label, you can build your own classifier from training data easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prebuilt Model Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extract valuable information and insights. These can be divided into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Entities: list of entities, such as people, places, and locations, identified in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key phrases: comprehend extracts key phrases that appear in a document. For example, a document about a basketball game might return the names of the teams, the name of the venue, and the final score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language - Amazon Comprehend identifies the dominant language in a document. It can identify 100 languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment - Amazon Comprehend determines the emotional sentiment of a document. Sentiment can be positive, neutral, negative, or mixed. *This is prebuilt tool we are going to use through the project.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax - Amazon Comprehend parses each word in your document and determines the part of speech for the word. For example, in the sentence \"It is raining today in Seattle,\" \"it\" is identified as a pronoun, \"raining\" is identified as a verb, and \"Seattle\" is identified as a proper noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document clustering or topic modeling: examine documents to organize them based on similar keywords within them.\n",
    "\n",
